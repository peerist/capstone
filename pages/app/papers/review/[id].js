  * has changed. It works a bit like this:
  * 
  * Iteration   Status of the query   Update the UI?
  * 1           fetching              Yes
  * 2           fetching              No

  * 1.  The segments that are already in the paper (selectedSegments) are saved to the state
  * which then appear in the UI on the right hand side. If there are no segments in the paper,
  * the state remains unchanged
  * 
  * 2.  To create the list of available segments, we take a list of all the user's segments,
  * and remove the segments which are already in this paper. This creates the "availableSegments"
  * list. 
  * 
  * The query above, getSelectedSegmentsAndAllSegments, actually has two requests in it. It requests
  * the segments that are in this paper authored by the logged in user, and all the segments in general
  * authored by the user. In order to know if a segment is NOT in the paper, we need to know which ones
  * already are in the paper. It is better to get all of this information in one query instead of two
